# Building a Logistic Regression

As we know in Machine Learning (ML), logistic regression is called Classification.

Create a logistic regression based on the bank data that I provide in this repository.

The data is based on the marketing campaign efforts of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

Note that the first column of the dataset is the index.
